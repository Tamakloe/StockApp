StockApp-GT is a simple rails application to check stock information.
It accepts a standard ticker symbol and outputs:

1. Trade Date
2. Last Trade Price
3. Stock Symbol
4. Company Name
5. Day's Low
6. Current Price
7. Day's High
8. Stock Exchange


StockApp-GT also gathers finance new from Yahoo for the chosen stock ticker.

Stock Details returned are saved to a database so that history comparison of your
selections over a time period can be made.
